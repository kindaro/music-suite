-- For a phrase, we simply use a voice without rests.
--
-- To represent a sequence of phrases we provide two equivalent representations:
--
-- * 'MVoice' is a sequence of notes/chords or rests. All consecutive non-rests consitute a phrase.
--
-- * 'PVoice' is a sequence of phrases or durations.
type Phrase a = Voice a

-- |
-- A sequence of phrases or rests, represented as notes or rests.
--
-- Each consecutive sequence of non-rest elements is considered to be a phrase.
-- For a more explicit representation of the phrase structure, see 'PVoice'.
type MVoice a = Voice (Maybe a)

-- |
-- A sequence of phrases or rests, represented with explicit phrase structure.
type PVoice a = [Either Duration (Phrase a)]

-- |
-- A sequence of phrases or rests, represented as phrases with an explicit onset.
--
-- This is only isomorphic to 'MVoice' (and 'PVoice') up to onset equivalence.
type TVoice a = Track (Phrase a)

-- |
-- Class of structures that can be traversed "by phrase".
--
-- A /phrase/ in this context is a sequence of consecutive notes played by the
-- same performer, with no rests in between. Phrase traverals are used for
-- attaching articulation marks, slurs and so on, but can also be used separately.

-}

{-
TODO get rid of the (a ~ b) restriction

To understand why it is there in the first place:

- Consider a score where some part has overlapping events

- The overlap means that singleMVoice will fail to match that particular part
  (this is why singleMVoice is a Prism and not an Iso/Lens).

- Consequently, the phrase traversal may not be able to modify certain parts, and must
  therefore retain them in their original form.

To get around this, we would need a version of singleMVoice that included voice separation.
That way, we would have the option to break up arbitrary scores into parts for them
purpose of the phrase traversal.
