-- This module defines a monomorphic representation of Western music notation.
--
-- Its main use to simplify the addition of notation-centric backends such as
-- Sibelius, MusicXML, Lilypond, ABC notation and so on.
--
-- It generally follows the conventions of MusixXML but has a slightly more
-- semantic flavor:
--
-- - Bars, staves and rhytmical structure is explicit.
--
-- - Spanners (legato, cresc dim etc) are represented by begin/end tags.
--
--   This is a consequence of representing the score as a tree rather than a graph,
--   as spanners exist independently of the /time/ hierarchy, and trees by
--   definition do not allow multiple hierarchical relationships.
--
--   It could be interesting to use some kind of graph structure instead.
--
-- - Harmoncics are represented as played, i.e. not by specifying note head shape
--   etc explicitly.
--
-- - Time and key signatures are global. Stave-specific key signatures, time
--   signatures or tempi is not allowed.
--
-- - The top level type is 'Work', which allow for representation of multi-movement
--   concert pieces as well as filmÂ and theatre music.
--
-- - Like Sibelius (and unlike MusicXML/Lilypond) we use a conceptual \"system
--   staff\" that contains information pertaining to all parts, such as key and
--   time signatures.

-- instrument or not (i.e. because it is part of a multi-staff part for i.e. piano,
-- organ or percussion).
--
-- The hireachy we use here is clear: a score contains staves which are organized
-- as a tree with bracket symbols at the branches. Traversing the tree gives us
-- the staves top-to-botom.
--
-- MusicXML by contrast includes two separate notions of parts and staves.
--
-- The score is a part/measure matrix, and the part-list element provides a
-- separate annotation for how parts are grouped (i.e. for brackets, barline convention
-- and in-between staff names). In MusicXML staves are not part of the hierarchy, but
-- are indicated separately: each part may specify a number of staves using
--
--   <attribute>
--     <staves>
--       N
--     </staves>
--   </attribute>
--
-- and certain elements (including notes note, forward and direction) [1] can
-- be tagget to indicate which staff they should be placed on.
--
-- Consequently things like a piano staff can be represented in two ways:
-- by using 2 (or more) explicist staves and a part-group, ur using a single part
-- and the staff annotations. The single-part approach seem to be favored for piano
-- music.
--
-- TODO we can also define multiple instrument parts using score-instrument,
-- and then assign individual notes (and which other objects?) to this.
